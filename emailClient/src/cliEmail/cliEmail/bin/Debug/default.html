TESTING 123!!!
<h3>HEY TEAM!!</h3>
<p>If you're reading this, then the email client is up and running! (yaaaay!)</p><br /><br />
Here are some of the features micrsoft's client can do:
<ol>
    <li>Encode emails in html <b>(Using it right now!)</b></li>
    <li>We can add attachments</li>
    <li>And also send to multiple people</li>
</ol>
<p>This email was created exactly the same way as a traditional html file with a few differences: first, There's no head or body (I'm guessing a body could be made though to add asthetics).
    Second, the subject of the page is at the very top of the document. (the html is read straight after).<br />Oh yeah! And all contact information, usernames and passwords are encrypted in a passowrd protected file. :D (eggScrambler)</p>
<p>I'm what would happen if I linked an image from the web... lets see...<br /><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/Cachorro_de_Bichon_Maltes.JPG/640px-Cachorro_de_Bichon_Maltes.JPG" style="border:10px solid orange;border-radius:15px" />
    <br />Not really sure if it'll work until I send it so good luck Mr.Image :P</p>
<p>Alright, If this actually works, i'm gonna push this out into a brand new branch! See you guys on slack!<br />
